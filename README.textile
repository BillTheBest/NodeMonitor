<h1>About</h1>
NodeMonitor is a distributed server monitoring system written in Javascript for <a href="http://github.com/ry/node">Node.JS</a>. It uses WebSockets to stream the data to the browser in near-realtime, and it uses a simple plugin system to add various monitoring capabilities to each node. <b>It is currently in a very alpha phase and a lot of functionality still needs to be added.</b> This is my first time ever using Node.JS so I'm sure the code could use a lot of improvement. Anyone who would like to contribute is welcome.

<h1>Requirements</h1>
* Linux/Unix (this includes Mac OSX; sorry, no Windows)
* <a href="http://github.com/ry/node">Node.JS</a>

<h1>How to Use</h1>
For a simple proof-of-concept:

* Configure config/server_config.js and config/node_config.js with the desired values. Should be pretty straightforward.
* Run the server on a single machine: sudo node NodeMonitor_Server.js
* Run the node on each machine you want to monitor (can be the same machine the server is running on): sudo node NodeMonitor_Node.js
* ????????
* PROFIT!

Use your web browser and go to the address and port specified in the config file to visit the NodeMonitor webpage. If a node is connected, you should see data streamed to console.log() in realtime.

<h1>What Needs to be Done?</h1>
* Basic plugins need to be finalized
* Web interface needs to be implemented
* Lots more error handling and fault tolerance needs to be added
